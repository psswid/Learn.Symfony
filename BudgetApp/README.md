# php basic cms

based on Finance App in Symfony 3 on yt/Code With Nate

Technologies used:
- Symfony4 (Twig, Doctrine)
- React (for basic displays)
- PSR-4

Project not finished, had to break with it, as fact this was my second contact with Symfony4 and first with React, so I can't overcome difficulties with this first attempt to full stack api application that allows tracking one budget (even as failed project I learned a lot of basics).

Basically, even author of yt channel had lots of problems, so I gave up to not waste time.

Database contains 3 tables: budget, expense and income_stream. Check database.json.

If someone would try to run it, type in console npm start in budget-app-front and then  php bin/console server:run in budget-app-api
